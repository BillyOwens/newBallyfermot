Human beings are social animals, and the tenor of our social life is one of the most important influences on our mental health. Without positive, durable
 relationships, both our minds and our bodies fall apart. We begin life dependent for survival on the quality of relationship with our primary caregiver,
 usually Mom. And the nature of that relationship typically influences all others in our life.
